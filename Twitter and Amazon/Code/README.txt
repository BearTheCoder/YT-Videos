There are 4 NuGets that are needed in order to make this program work.
  1. Ae.Net.Mail
  2. Selenium.WebDriver
  3. System.Text.Encoding.CodePages
  4. TweetinviAPI
  
 You also need to download ChromeDriver (and Google Chrome if not already downloaded) to get this to work:
 http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
 You need to download 104.0.5112.79 as of 09/11/22
 
 program.cs is HEAVILY and UNNECESSARILY commented to shit, so it should be easy to understand and follow if you have some coding knowledge.
